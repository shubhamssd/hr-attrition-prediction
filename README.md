# hr-attrition-prediction

🎯 Project Goal:

Analyze employee data to discover patterns in attrition and build a predictive model that identifies employees likely to leave.

🧩 Dataset:

Kaggle → IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset

⚙️ Tech Stack:

Python, Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (for EDA & dashboards)

Scikit-learn (for ML model)

Streamlit / Power BI (optional dashboard for Data Analyst touch)

🪄 Steps Overview:

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Clean data, handle missing values, encode categorical columns.

Visualize attrition trends by department, salary, job role, etc.

Use correlation heatmaps and boxplots for insight discovery.

Feature Engineering

Convert categorical data → numeric using Label Encoding or OneHotEncoding.

Create features like “YearsSinceLastPromotionRatio”.

Modeling (Data Scientist Part)

Split data into train/test sets.

Try Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluate with Accuracy, F1-Score, ROC-AUC.

Visualization / Dashboard (Data Analyst Part)

Create summary dashboards in Power BI or Streamlit showing:

Attrition by Age Group, Department, Job Role

Key features influencing attrition
